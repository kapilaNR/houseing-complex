# Housing Complex 3D Visualization Project

This is a Next.js project with Three.js for creating a 3D visualization of a housing complex exterior.

## Project Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns
- Use Three.js for 3D rendering and scene management
- Apply Tailwind CSS for styling UI components
- Create reusable components for 3D elements
- Optimize performance for web rendering
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Maintain clean code structure with proper TypeScript types

## 3D Development Guidelines

- Use Three.js best practices for scene, camera, and renderer setup
- Implement proper lighting for architectural visualization
- Create modular 3D components for buildings, landscape, etc.
- Use efficient geometry and materials for web performance
- Implement camera controls for user interaction
- Consider responsive design for different screen sizes

## Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Follow semantic naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Organize code in logical folder structures
